Privacy Policy – Karaoke Party Time

Last updated: 21 November 2025

This Privacy Policy explains how Karaoke Party Time (“the App”, “we”, “us”) handles information when you use the App and its related website at YOUR_APP_WEBSITE_URL.
The App is a party game that lets you add songs and players, randomly assign who sings what, and optionally import playlists from Spotify. It is designed to work primarily on your device, with minimal data sent to us.
By using the App, you agree to the practices described in this Privacy Policy.

1. Information We Collect
We aim to keep data collection to the minimum necessary for the App to function and for you to send us feedback.
We group information into two categories:

1.1. Data stored only on your device
The following data is saved locally on your device (e.g. browser storage / local storage) and is not sent to our servers, except where explicitly stated:
List of songs you add (title, artist, and whether it is Solo or Duet).
List of players you add (player names and any songs you dedicate to them).
Basic game state (e.g. random sequence of songs/players for your current game).
This information is controlled by you and can usually be cleared by:
Using in-app buttons such as “Clear Songs” or “Clear Players”, and/or
Clearing your browser / app data or reinstalling the app.
We do not have direct access to this local-only data.

1.2. Data you send when using the Feedback feature
If you choose to use the in-app Feedback form, we may receive:
The content of your feedback message
Any contact details you choose to provide (e.g. email address, name)
Technical information automatically provided by your email provider or hosting platform (such as IP address, timestamp, and basic metadata)
This information is used only so we can:
Read your feedback
Respond to you if you request a reply
Improve the App based on your comments
We do not use this feedback data for marketing, profiling, or advertising.

2. Spotify Connect and Playlist Import
The App includes an optional feature to import songs from your Spotify playlists.
When you choose to connect your Spotify account:
You are redirected to Spotify’s secure login/consent pages.
Spotify may share certain information with the App, such as:
Access tokens/permissions needed to read your playlists
Names of playlists and tracks used to import songs into the App
We use this information only to:
Show your playlists in the import screen
Import selected tracks into your local song list inside the App
We do not:
Store your Spotify password
Permanently store your Spotify data on our own servers beyond what is necessary for the import flow
Use Spotify data for advertising or selling to third parties
Spotify’s own processing of your data is governed by Spotify’s Privacy Policy, not ours. Please review Spotify’s terms and privacy policy for more details.
You can stop using the Spotify feature at any time by:
Disconnecting within the App if available, and/or
Revoking access to the App in your Spotify account settings.

3. How We Use Information
We use information only for the following purposes:
Provide core functionality – storing songs, players, and game state on your device.
Process your requests – such as importing Spotify playlists you select.
Respond to feedback – reading and replying (if you’ve asked us to) and improving the App.
Security and troubleshooting – basic logs and error information from our hosting or email service may be used to keep the App running reliably.
We do not use your information for targeted advertising or user profiling.

4. Legal Basis (Where Applicable)
Where relevant privacy laws apply (such as the UK GDPR / EU GDPR), we rely on:
Consent – when you:
Connect your Spotify account
Submit feedback voluntarily
Legitimate interests – for:
Running and improving the App
Debugging issues and ensuring security
You can withdraw consent at any time by:
Stopping use of the relevant feature (e.g., feedback, Spotify import), and/or
Revoking access in third-party settings (e.g., Spotify account page).

5. Data Sharing and Third Parties
We do not sell your personal data.
We may share limited data with third parties only in these situations:
Service providers – for example:
Email or hosting providers that handle feedback messages or crash/error logs
Legal reasons – if we are required to do so by law, or to protect our rights, users, or others
Any such providers are expected to use the data only to provide their services to us.

6. Data Retention
Local App Data (songs, players, game state)
Stored only on your device and retained until you clear it or uninstall the App.
Feedback Messages
Retained in our email or ticket systems for as long as needed to:
Respond to you
Keep reasonable records of product feedback and support
You may request that we delete specific feedback emails where legally possible.

7. Children’s Privacy
The App is intended for general audiences and may be used in family environments. It is not specifically targeted at children under 13.
We do not knowingly collect personal data from children without appropriate consent where required by law. If you believe a child has provided personal data to us without consent, please contact us at karaokepartytime@yahoo.com and we will review and delete it where appropriate.

8. Your Rights
Depending on your location, you may have rights over your personal data, including:
Access to the personal data we hold about you
Correction of inaccurate data
Deletion of your data (where legally possible)
Restriction or objection to certain types of processing
Since most app data is stored locally on your device, you can often exercise control directly by:
Clearing songs, players, and game state within the App
Clearing your device/app data
Uninstalling the App
For feedback or other data we hold, you can contact us at YOUR_CONTACT_EMAIL and we will respond in line with applicable law.

9. International Transfers
If you contact us or use the App from outside the country where our services are hosted, your data may be processed in other countries which may have different data protection laws.
Where required, we take reasonable steps to protect your information in accordance with applicable legal requirements.

10. Changes to This Privacy Policy
We may update this Privacy Policy from time to time. The “Last updated” date at the top indicates the latest version.
If we make significant changes, we may notify you via the App, our website, or other appropriate means.

11. Contact Us
If you have any questions about this Privacy Policy or how we handle data, please contact:
